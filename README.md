## Detecting changes in satellite data
#### Briefly about the project:
* Using Jupyter Notebook, Python3, scikit-learn and other Python libraries
* Uploading two satellite pictures of the same area several months apart
* Transforming each picture into $n \times n \times 3$ array
* Creating a Tree with 3 (Red, Green, Blue) characteristics and adding classes such as "water", "vegetation", "urban", etc
* Getting a classification of each picture
* Getting a change detection binary matrix
* Getting a result picture of changes occured within several months
